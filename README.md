# 🤝 Sheyar Live Share

## 🎯 About

I used to share files between computer and phone through USB, Gmail, Drive, or WhatsApp which is quite tedious and sometimes it wastes a lot of time. Therefore, I developed a site Sheyar, where you can share files between two remote locations. You can share N number of files of any type. Works smoothly in chrome and Firefox. And the most amazing thing about this tool is- it doesn't compress or degrade the file size or quality. It's very simple, fast and Easy to use.

## ▶️ Demo
